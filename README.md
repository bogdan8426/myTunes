## The MVC Design pattern
><b>Model–View–Controller</b> (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. Following the MVC architectural pattern decouples these major components allowing for code reuse and parallel development.
