## 2. Architecture

### Angular
#### ES6 and TypeScript
ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript International. It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting. Languages like JavaScript, Jscript and ActionScript are governed by this specification.
JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich, a developer at Netscape Communications Corporation, in 1995.JavaScript started life with the name Mocha, and was briefly named LiveScript before being officially renamed to JavaScript. It is a scripting language that is executed by the browser, i.e. on the client’s end. It is used in conjunction with HTML to develop responsive webpages.

By definition, “TypeScript is JavaScript for application-scale development.”
TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language. It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#) at Microsoft. TypeScript is both a language and a set of tools. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript compiled to JavaScript. In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features.

#### Angular CLI
The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that you use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications. You can use the tool directly in a command shell, or indirectly through an interactive UI such as Angular Console.
#### Webpack
At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.

#### Spring
Spring is a framework for the Java platform comprising many modules. Among them are Spring Core, Spring Security and Spring Data.
* allows for more modular and loosely coupled code
* allows for easier testing
* when we need to replace a concrete implementation with another one, our application code should not need to change.
Spring Boot is a project which helps with faster development speed.
It favors convention over configuration: you specify which Spring dependencies to use in the project and Spring Boot gives reasonable configuration defaults for them.
